# Capstone Choose Your Own Project: Predict House Price
## Using Linear Regression and Random Forest approach for Regression

The project is composed of 3 files: `code_house_price_proj.R`, `report_house_price_proj.Rmd` and
`report_house_price_proj.pdf`.  

For this specific project, the structure of its directories is:  

- __capstone-cyo-proj-pred-house-price__/
    - __rdas__/
        - cp_house_price.rda
    - __raw_data__/
        - data.csv
- README.md
- report_house_price_proj.Rmd
- code_house_price_proj.R
- report_house_price_proj.pdf


## The `code_house_price_proj.R` file

This file contents all the code used from prepare the project and download the dataset from a
specific internet site until build and test four models to predict House Price, in the following way:
We fit two models, one performs a linear regression with the `lm()` function and the other ones an
random forest approach for regression with the `randomForest` function from the `randomForest` package,
in a dataset that has outliers. And fit other two models, performing the same algorithms used in the
first two models, in a dataset without them.

## The `report_house_price_proj.Rmd` document

This `Rmd` document was renderized to generate the PDF document `report_house_price_proj.pdf`.  
<br />
## The `report_house_price_proj.pdf` final report

This is the final report that was generated from the `Rmd` document. And it consists of 4 chapters and by an extra section called Appendix,
which are described as follows: __Chapter 1 Overview__ describes the dataset, summarizes the
goal of the project and key steps that were performed. In __Chapter 2 Methods and Analysis__
explains the process and techniques used, for example, data science project preparation, data
exploration and visualization, preparation and cleaning of the datasets, preparation of the training and testing datasets.
Also, the insights gained during the course, and the modeling approach used. __Chapter 3 Results__
presents the modeling results and discusses the model performance. In __Chapter 4 Conclusion__
gives a brief summary of the report, its limitations and future work. And finally, in the extra
section __Appendix__, that is divided into two parts, shows the information about the computer
equipment used, its hardware specs, `R` session, the Operating Systems (OS) where this code was
made (Appendix A) and tested (Appendix B), and the loaded packages.
